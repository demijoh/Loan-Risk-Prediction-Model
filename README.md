# Loan-Risk-Prediction-Model
This repository contains the complete code and resources for a data science project focused on building a machine learning model to predict loan default risk. The goal of this project is to provide a tool for financial institutions to make more informed lending decisions by identifying high-risk applicants.

The project follows a standard data science pipeline:

1.Data Ingestion & Cleaning: Merging and preprocessing raw datasets.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data's characteristics and identifying key features.

3.Feature Engineering: Creating new, more predictive features from the raw data.

4.Model Building & Evaluation: Training and evaluating various machine learning models, with a focus on an XGBoost classifier.

5. Model Interpretation: Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain the model's predictions.
